# Cancer or UI (cat diagnosis)

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. This is a gag cite dedicated to given poor diagnoses for cats based on inputs from the user. There are a few different types of cancer taken from a repository of cancer types. There are only two types of diagnosis, cancer (with type) or UI. This is based off a real experience that my family had where the vets gave different diagnoses but none of it was helpful or reliable.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable



For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator Pitch

This is a website made for fun and experience but still trying to bring attention to the lack of focus on pet healthcare. Healthcare for humans has to be correct for the sake of a person's life but petcare doesn't have to be as accurate or researched. While many people are attached to their pets, these pets are not as important to them as the lives of their parents but that doesn't mean that the healthcare can be unreliable. This website has to the goal to bring attention to how bad their diagnoses can be.
